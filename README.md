# jest-nock
_Automate request traffic recording and replay for tests._

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/jest-nock.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/jest-nock)

Instead of mocking requests or setting up nock for every test manually,
this setup allows to mark tests that make requests to other systems and
automatically record and replay requests made during a test run.
After recording the requests for your test suite, it will never make real network requests again, so you don't need these external systems available during a test run and your test suite will run much faster, while still ensuring your project integrates well will the used APIs.

## Example
```js
it.nock('uses some method that makes requests to external services', () => {
    const result = await makeSomeRequestsAndCombineThem();
    expect(result).toBe(derivate);
});
```

## Install
```
yarn add jest-nock
```

To use `jest-nock` with your jest setup, add it to your [testFramework file setup](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/configuration.html#setuptestframeworkscriptfile-string) as follows:
```js
const { upgradeJasmine } = require('jest-nock');

upgradeJasmine(jasmine, global);
```


## Usage
 - Mark a test to be recorded/replayed with `it.nock(...)`
 - Set `JEST_NOCK_RECORD=true` in your environment and run the tests you want to record against some real/mock/test API.

Recorded requests will be stored in a folder called `__nocks__` next to the file containing the test/suite.
